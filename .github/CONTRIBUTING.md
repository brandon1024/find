# Contributing to {find+}
We need help! We feel this project has great potential, but there is a lot of work to go around. If you are interested in becoming a contributor, reading this document should help you get started.

All contributions from the community must follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting an Issue
Did you notice an issue? We probably missed something. Let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/brandon1024/find/issues). Be sure to check whether the issue has already been brought up (expand upon the issue if you have more details), or whether the issue has been fixed in a new release.

In creating a new issue, ensure you use a succinct title, full description, and images if applicable.

If you think you can fix the issue yourself, follow the steps to become a contributor. If you feel the issue is outside of your comfort zone, you can mention someone in the description or assign the issue to another developer.

## Making Changes
Our project follows the git-flow. This means that we have a `master` (stable-release) branch, and a `develop` (beta) branch. All proposed changes must be targeted at the `develop` branch.

Once you create a fork of this repository, you can make your changes on a feature branch and open a pull request to the upstream project when it's ready.

Once you think your changes are ready to be merged, create a pull request. Use a succinct title, full description, and images if applicable. Linking a pull request to the original issue helps the reviewer when testing your changes. Provide a description of how you tested your changes locally. Another developer will review your changes, provide feedback, and merge once everything looks good.

## Reviewing a Pull Request
Code reviews plays an important part of our development cycle. As a reviewer, it's important to check that fixes/functionality is working as described, that the changes follow good style guidelines, and that the changes provide value to the project.
