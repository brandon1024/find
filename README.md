# **{find+}**
**{find+}** is a simple _Find-in-Page_ extension for Google Chrome hosting a the ability to search a web page or document by regular expression. It has been designed to look and behave much like the `CTRL-F` function, but extended to provide a feature-rich and robust user experience with the aim of completely replacing the native _Find-in-Page_ tool.

Our principle is simple, to deliver a reliable, robust, repeatable, performant, and native-like tool for the software and web development industry. _Perfection is simply not good enough._

## Motivation
As a software developer, looking through lengthy stack traces, continuous integration build history, or large text files is something we do very regularly. The Chrome _Find-in-Page_ tool works well in most cases, but offers very little when looking for very specific (or very general) keywords.

The idea to build this tool spawned as a response to poorly designed or dysfunctional regex-search extensions currently available, and the limited usefulness of the native tool. This extension has become a growing project aimed at giving developers better tools to simplify certain tasks and to improve upon the functionally-limited tools currently available.

## Getting Started
The **{find+}** Chrome extension has recently transitioned to public beta and has become available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions). You can install the extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/find%2B/fddffkdncgkkdjobemgbpojjeffmmofb).

Feeling bold? You can also install the extension by using Developer Mode under the Chrome extension settings. These steps will help you get started.

Before you begin, ensure that you install the extension from the `master` branch. All other branches are under active development, which may not be stable.

First, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by clicking the green `Clone or Download` button in GitHub. If you are comfortable using git, you can copy the HTTPS clone link to your clipboard and clone the repository to a location on your local machine by running the following command in the terminal:

```
cd <directory you want to clone to>
git clone <clone link from clipboard>
```
<sup>Note: If you are using a Windows machine, you may need to install git [here](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).</sup>

Otherwise, you can click `Download ZIP` and extract the source files to a location on your computer. Ensure you are viewing the `master` branch.

To install the extension in Chrome, navigate to the Settings page in Chrome and click `Extensions` on the left. Enabling Developer Mode will show a button to `Load Unpacked Extension`, which you can use to navigate to the parent folder of the extension. Yay! You installed the extension!
